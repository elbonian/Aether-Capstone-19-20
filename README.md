## About Aether
Aether is an interactive 3D rendition of the solar system which runs inside your web browser. 
Aether is built using the SPICE system from JPL/NAIF, allowing it to visualize object trajectories 
over time with high scientific accuracy. In addition, it also visualizes the rotations and radii of 
major celestial bodies.

The motivation behind our project is to give NASA mission designers an easy way to visualize and 
compare the trajectories of different celestial bodies and spacecraft. Therefore, Aetherâ€™s core 
design is centered around flexibility and extensibility. Users may create custom simulations with 
any origin (e.g Solar System Barycenter, Pluto Barycenter, Mars, etc.) In addition, users may upload 
new binary SPK kernels to Aether, allowing for custom trajectories to be visualized.

Aether has two main components, the backend and frontend. The backend consists of a REST 
server which provides data (positions for trajectories, mass/radii, rotation equations, etc. from 
SPICE kernels) to the frontend for visualization. The frontend consists of a web-based 3D visualization 
written in Javascript using the Spacekit.js and THREE.js frameworks.

## Recommended System Requirements
- At least 4 GB free space on the filesystem (default SPICE kernel set is ~3 GB)
- 8 GB RAM (recommended)
- Dedicated GPU (highly recommended for smooth frame-rate, but not required)

## Installation
To install Aether on your computer, first clone the repository or obtain an archive of the source 
code.

### Backend Dependencies
Installation of the backend requires the docker command-line interface. Installing docker depends on 
your OS. 

_Note that docker requires virtualization is enabled within the BIOS._

#### Installing Docker

##### Debian/Ubuntu
On Debian-based Linux distros, docker can be easily installed via `apt`. Run the following commands 
to install it...

    sudo apt install docker.io
    sudo systemctl start docker
    sudo systemctl enable docker
    
This installs docker and enables the docker daemon so that it runs by default.

##### Windows, Mac, other Linux distributions 

For Windows and Mac, Docker Desktop may be installed by following the provided instructions 
[here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

For non-Debian-based Linux distros, docker provides package files for installation, which can 
be found [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

### Frontend Dependencies
Installing the frontend requires both `node` and `npm` to be installed first.

#### Installing Node.js and Node package manager
To install Node.js and npm on both Windows and Mac, download the installer 
[here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

For Linux, install Node.js and npm via snap or a package manager. Instructions can be found 
[here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/).


**LINUX AND MAC USERS, READ THIS:**

The rest of the installation has been automated. Run `install.sh` in your 
terminal to automatically build the backend docker image, create the docker container and 
install required Node.js packages. After running this script, skip to "Running the Application" 
below.

**WINDOWS USERS**

We're sorry but you'll have to do this manually. Please follow the instructions in 
the next two sections.

#### Building the Docker Image and Container
Once docker has been installed on your machine, open a terminal and navigate to the 
`Aether-Capstone-19-20` directory. Run the following commands to build the backend docker image...

    cd backend/
    sudo docker build -t aether-backend:v1 .

_Note: Building the docker image may take ~15 minutes depending on your internet speed. This is 
because the docker must download approximately 3 GB of SPICE kernels from JPL/NAIF._

After the image is finished being built, run the following command to create the container...

    sudo docker create -it --name="Aether-Backend" -p 5000:5000 aether-backend:v1

#### Installing Frontend Node Packages
Once Node.js and npm are installed on your computer, once again open a terminal and navigate to 
the `Aether-Capstone-19-20` directory. Run the following commands to install the frontend 
dependencies...

    cd frontend/
    npm install

    
## Running the Application
**LINUX AND MAC USERS, READ THIS:**

Running the application has been automated. Run `run.sh` in your terminal to start the 
application, then connect to localhost:8080 from your web browser.

**WINDOWS USERS:** 

The application must be run manually, please continue reading this section.

### Start the backend
To run the backend, use the following command to star the docker container you built 
previously...

    sudo docker start Aether-Backend

### Start the frontend
From the `Aether-Capstone-19-20` directory, run the following command to start the frontend...

    node frontend/server.js
    
Now that both the backend and frontend are both running, connect to localhost:8080 from your web 
browser.

### Stopping the application
To stop the backend docker container, run the following command...

    sudo docker stop Aether-Backend
    
To stop the Node.js web server, simply use `Ctrl+C` from the terminal where the Node server is 
running.

### Aside - backend debug mode
If you wish to view a log of API requests or modify files on the container, read on.
Perform actions in this section at your own risk, modifying files within the backend container 
may break the application. A familiarity with docker is strongly recommended for debugging.

To view the current log of API requests within the backend, run the following command from a 
separate terminal...

    sudo docker attach Aether-Backend

To modify files on the backend, you must rebuild the image and container after modifying the files 
locally. See installation instructions above for the corresponding commands.

## Tutorials

### Add new objects to the current simulation
After the simulation initially loads, you will see a box on the left titled "Visible Bodies." Within 
this menu, you can toggle object visibility, zoom to objects, and load new objects into the simulation. 
Click on a category (e.g Sun, Mercury, Spacecraft) to expand it. In this drop-down, any name in black 
text is already loaded in the simulation. Any name that is grayed out is available from the backend, 
but is not currently loaded into the simulation. Click the '+' on the object you would like to add. 
The name should change to black text once the data has been retrieved. At this point you can view and 
interact with the object.

### Changing the rate of time and tail length
The simulation's rate of time is displayed at the top-center of the screen underneath the current date. 
The rate of time is 0 when the simulation is paused. Within the "Time Controls" menu on the left, either 
adjust the slider to change the rate of time, or enter a value in JD/sec manually. This will not resume 
the simulation if it is paused.

Similarly, to change the tail length (length of trajectory line for each object, represented in JD prior
to current date). Use the corresponding slider/input form on the "Time Controls" menu.

### Zooming to objects and viewing object info
Within the "Visible Bodies" menu, you may right click on any object that is loaded in the current 
simulation (i.e. if the name's text is black, see the tutorial on adding new objects above). Here 
you should see options to zoom to the object, or view its info.

![Object Zoom/Info](https://github.com/MattM-CU/Aether-Capstone-19-20/blob/master/doc_assets/body-info.png)

### Uploading new binary SPK SPICE kernels
Within the "Visible Bodies" menu on the left, there is a button titled "Upload New SPK Kernel." 
Clicking this button will open a prompt. Selecting "Browse" will open a file explorer where you can 
select a file for uploading. Only binary SPK SPICE kernels (.bsp) may be uploaded, otherwise a 
warning will appear. Once the file has been uploaded, the new bodies contained in that kernel will 
be automatically added to the "Visible Bodies" drop-down in the appropriate category. For example, 
if the kernel contains a spacecraft, that object will appear in the Spacecraft drop-down. If an object 
is a moon of Jupiter, it will appear in the Jupiter drop-down.

A large repository of publicly-available SPK kernels can be found on the 
[NAIF website](https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/data.html).

### Creating a new simulation
Under the simulation/time controls menu on the lower left, towards the bottom of the menu there is a 
"Reset" button. This button allows you to create a new simulation at any starting date/time, with any 
object as the origin. Default bodies to load must be specified, but more can always be added via the 
"Visible Bodies" menu. See the screenshot below for an example.

![Create Sim Form](https://github.com/MattM-CU/Aether-Capstone-19-20/blob/master/doc_assets/create-new-sim.png)

### Comparing two simulations
Comparing two simulations is quite useful for seeing the differences in object trajectories. For 
instance, comparing two different proposed trajectories for a new mission. In Aether, one may 
compare two simulations by clicking the "Compare" button towards the bottom of the simulation/time 
controls menu. A form will then pop up (see screenshot below), allowing users to customize the origin, 
included objects and start date of each simulation. The specified granularity will be applied to both 
simulations, and changing the rate of time or tail length affects both as well.

The result is two side-by-side simulations which are synced with respect to camera orientation, rate 
of time and trajectory tail length. See the 
[comparison](https://github.com/MattM-CU/Aether-Capstone-19-20/blob/master/screenshots/clipper_eveega_vs_jup_direct.png)
of two proposed Europa-Clipper trajectories in the screenshots directory for an example.

#### Comparing two different trajectories with the same SPICE ID
The example linked above compares the trajectories contained in two different SPK kernels for Europa-Clipper. 
The issue that arises in these situations is that both objects contain data for the same SPICE ID, which Aether 
cannot differentiate between. To accomplish this task, one must first modify the SPICE ID for the conflicting 
object in one of the two kernels before uploading them.

Fortunately, modifying the SPICE ID for an object contained in a binary SPK kernel is easy and can be 
accomplished using a command-line utility from JPL/NAIF. Download the `bspidmod` program for your OS 
from NAIF's utilities repository [here](https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/utilities.html). Afterwards, 
make the program executable using `chmod` and follow the instructions below...

    ./bspidmod -spki <path-to-SPK>.bsp -idi <object ID to change> -ido <new object ID> -mod target

This will change the object ID specified by _-idi_ within the given SPK kernel to the ID specified by 
_-ido_. By default, this will not overwrite the given SPK kernel, but instead create a new one with 
a suffix of "_out".

Here is an example of the same command for a Europa-Clipper kernel. Note that the spacecraft's 
initial ID was -159 and it was converted to -169. This also changes the name of the object to the 
specified output ID. After running the command, the file `15F09_EVEE_L220602_A300115_V1_scpse_out.bsp` 
is generated.

    ./bspidmod -spki 15F09_EVEE_L220602_A300115_V1_scpse.bsp -idi -159 -ido -169 -mod target

## Uninstall
**LINUX AND MAC USERS, READ THIS:**

Uninstalling the application has been automated. Run `uninstall.sh` in your terminal to delete the 
backend docker container and image.

**WINDOWS USERS:** 

The application must be uninstalled manually, please continue reading this section.

### Delete the docker container
First, ensure the docker container exists and is stopped. To do this run `sudo docker ps` and make 
sure that the Aether-Backend container does not appear as running. Then run `sudo docker ps -a` to 
make sure the container does indeed exist. After verifying these two things, run the following 
command to delete the container...

    sudo docker rm Aether-Backend

### Delete the docker image
Next, delete the docker image...

    sudo docker rmi aether-backend:v1
    
After both the container and image have been removed, you may delete your local copy of the 
repository.


## Code Walkthrough

### Backend

The primary component of the backend is a REST API which serves trajectory data (position 
coordinates and their corresponding times) and meta-data for available bodies (radii, mass, rotation 
equations, valid time ranges) to the frontend. It also handles uploading new SPK kernels. Below is a 
brief description of each endpoint within `aether-rest-server.py` and other files which aid in 
its execution.

#### API Endpoints
This is a brief description of each API endpoint, see the docstrings and comments within 
`aether-rest-server.py` for further details.

##### Positions

<u>URL Format:</u> 

>/api/positions/\<string:ref_frame>/\<string:targets>/\<string:curVizJd>/\<string:curVizJdDelta>/\<string:tailLenJd>/\<int:validSeconds>

<u>Methods:</u>

>GET

<u>Description:</u>

This endpoint is used by the frontend for obtaining the positions of each target at a 
specified time, with a specified range both prior to, and after that time. Multiple targets may be 
passed in the "targets" field by separating their names or IDs with a '+'.

<u>Example Calls:</u>

This call is an example of an initial positions request that the frontend performs on initialization. 
Here, curVizJdDelta represents the current time. The reference frame is "solar system barycenter," 
the granularity is 0.08333 days and the tail length is 200 days.

    http://0.0.0.0:5000/api/positions/solar system barycenter/sun+mercury+venus+earth+mars+jupiter+saturn+uranus+neptune+pluto+moon/2458988.40703/0.08333333333/200/20
    
This call is an example of an update request for a single object. Here, the tail length is 0 days 
because only future data is needed.
